            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                In modern financial markets, risk management is more critical than ever due to the complex interdependencies
                among assets and sectors. Traditional models like Value-at-Risk (VaR) offer a univariate perspective on tail
                risks, which often misses how crises propagate across interconnected assets. To address this limitation,
                this study employs a multivariate approach using copulas and DCC-GARCH models. The research specifically
                focuses on estimating Conditional Value-at-Risk (CoVaR), which captures systemic risk by assessing the
                conditional distribution of one asset given distress in another.

            <h2>Background Theory</h2>
            <p>
                This work builds upon foundational statistical concepts like probability distributions and joint modeling.
                Central to this is the use of copulas—a method to model and understand dependencies between multiple
                financial variables, irrespective of their marginal distributions. Sklar’s Theorem provides the theoretical
                underpinning, allowing the separation of marginal behavior from dependence structure. The study explores
                various families of copulas, including elliptical (Gaussian and Student-t) and Archimedean (Clayton and
                Gumbel), each offering unique properties for capturing tail behavior and asymmetric risk.

            <h2>Modeling Framework</h2>
            <p>
                The study leverages a hybrid modeling framework combining:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>GARCH models</strong> to capture time-varying volatility in individual asset returns.</li>
                <li><strong>Dynamic Conditional Correlation (DCC)</strong> to allow the correlations among assets to evolve
                    over time.</li>
                <li><strong>Copula functions</strong> to model the dependency structure across multiple assets based on the
                    filtered residuals from GARCH.</li>
            </ul>
            This modular setup allows precise modeling of financial time series while decoupling the marginal and joint
            dynamics, essential for robust risk quantification.

            <h2>Data and Preprocessing</h2>
            <p>
                The dataset comprises 5 years of daily stock prices from six multinational companies across three sectors:
                Energy (Chevron, Exxon), Consumer Staples (Coca-Cola, PepsiCo), and Financial Services (Mastercard, Visa).
                Preprocessing includes computing daily log returns, aligning data across a common timeline, removing any
                incomplete records, and validating basic statistical assumptions. The resulting dataset is robust and ready
                for high-fidelity modeling, consisting of over 1,250 aligned observations.
            </p>
        </section>
    
        <section>
            <h2>Model Results and Insights</h2>
            <p>
                The model outputs offer granular insights into both individual and systemic risk. DCC-GARCH estimates of VaR
                and CVaR show that the diversified High-Corr portfolio reduces overall risk exposure. CoVaR analysis reveals
                significant systemic influence from high-capitalization assets like Visa and Mastercard. Risk metrics such
                as Pearson correlation and Energy Score are used to validate the quality of each copula family’s fit. The
                research highlights how copula selection dramatically impacts perceived risk in tail events, supporting
                tailored modeling strategies for portfolio risk managers.

        <section>
            <h2>Stress Testing and Portfolio Analysis</h2>
            <p>
                Stress testing is used to simulate extreme scenarios where a particular asset is under financial distress.
                The study evaluates how shocks in one asset—e.g., Exxon Mobil—propagate throughout the portfolio. The
                resulting Delta-CoVaR values quantify the systemic impact and reveal how risk amplifies through asset
                interconnections. Comparisons between individual assets and the High-Corr portfolio further illustrate the
                effectiveness of diversification in absorbing shocks and reducing overall exposure.
            </p>
        </section>
    
        <section>
            <h2>Copula Selection and Goodness-of-Fit</h2>
            <p>
                Each copula family is assessed for its ability to model real-world financial dependencies. The Gaussian
                copula exhibits the lowest AIC/BIC and is optimal for symmetric, low-tail risk environments. The Student-t
                copula performs better in capturing heavy tails, while the Clayton and Gumbel copulas specialize in lower-
                and upper-tail dependencies respectively. Fit metrics such as Energy Score and Kendall’s Tau ensure the
                chosen copula reflects the actual behavior of financial assets, enabling more accurate forecasting and
                stress scenario analysis.

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                This study concludes that copula-based multivariate modeling provides superior insights into financial risk
                compared to traditional approaches. By integrating GARCH for volatility modeling, DCC for evolving
                correlations, and copulas for dependency structures, it presents a comprehensive risk framework. The results
                underscore the importance of copula selection, asset correlation analysis, and diversification in designing
                resilient investment strategies. Overall, this research equips financial analysts and risk managers with a
                robust methodology for navigating systemic risks.
