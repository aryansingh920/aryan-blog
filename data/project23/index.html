                and magnetic levitation technologies.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Superfluidity:</strong> Liquids like helium transition into a superfluid state, flowing without
                viscosity.
                This has significant implications for understanding quantum mechanics and developing advanced cooling
                systems.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Minimal Thermal Noise:</strong> At such low temperatures, thermal energy is drastically reduced,
                allowing for highly sensitive measurements and experiments in fields like astrophysics and particle
                physics.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Cryogenics brings us closer to absolute zero by utilizing techniques like gas liquefaction and adiabatic
            demagnetization.
